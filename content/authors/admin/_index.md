I am a machine learning researcher, consultant, and an undergraduate student at the Massachussets Institute of Technology. I'm passionate about machine learning as a tool for effecting positive change. In my free time I enjoy reading Stoic/Buddhist philosophy, stargazing, singing Indian classical music, and walking my dog, Peanut.
